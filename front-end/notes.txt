what data does the employer need when login in?
Total job posts
    applicant count per job post
    status of jobs

applicants
    status of applicants

how should the employer know the status of the jobs?
Set a status column on each job? or a second table?

job =
    {
        title,
        id,
        location{
            city,
            state,
            zip
        },
        description
    }

applicant = {
    id,
    firstName,
    lastName,
    email,
    homePhone,
    cellPhone,
    resume,
    coverLetter,
    (hasMany)notes
}

jbUser = {
    id,
    firstName,
    lastName,
    email,
    password
}

employer = {
    id,
    name,
    location{
        city,
        state,
        zip
    },
    logoImg,
    website,
    twitter,
    facebook,
    linkedIn
}

jobApplication = {
    id,
    applicantId,
    jobId
}

notes = {
    id,
    date,
    note,
    applicantId
}

applicantNotes = {
