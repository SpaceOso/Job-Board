how should the company know the status of the jobs?
Set a status column on each job? or a second table?

job =

        id,
        address{
            city,
            state,
            zip
        },
        description
    }

applicant = {
    id,
    firstName,
    lastName,
    email,
    homePhone,
    cellPhone,
    resume,
    coverLetter,
    (hasMany)notes
}

jbUser = {
    id,
    firstName,
    lastName,
    email,
    password
}

company = {
    id,
    name,
    address{
        city,
        state,
        zip
    },
    logoImg,
    website,
    twitter,
